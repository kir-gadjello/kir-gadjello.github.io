Hi! My name is Kirill Gadjello and I've worked in various companies, large and small, [some of which are better known for their image search](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23976172).
While I'm proud of my professional accomplishments, I find it especially joyous to explore novel areas in a self-directed fashion.

I'm interested in collborating on cool public and private projects, don't hesitate to reach out to me!
